    <ul>
        <li>A pen tool, for drawing with thin lines</li>
        <li>A pencil tool, which draws thicker lines than the pen</li>
        <li>A paintbrush tool, which draws even thicker lines with a wet, paint-like quality</li>
        <li>A charcoal pencil tool, which is similar to the pencil, but draws rougher lines</li>
        <li>A spray gun tool, which places randomly distributed pixels over a wide area</li>
        <li>Three coloured highlighters, which take on the colours of the user's selected palette</li>
        <li>An eraser tool, which can be used to erase parts of lines drawn previously</li>
        <li>A dynamite tool, which clears the canvas and resets it to a blank state</li>
        <li>A limited, three-colour palette, with a selection of pre-set palettes, as well as the option to create a custom palette</li>

    <h2>
        What features/mechanics indicate its genre by aligning with its conventions?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Wigglypaint presents the user with common drawing tools like a pencil and paintbrush, and provides a blank canvas on which to use them to create their art. As is typical for this kind of tool, the user can export their work to an image file to share with others.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What features/mechanics are novel for its genre?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The tool's defining feature is the wobbly animation that applies to anything drawn. Because of this, it supports exporting in animated GIF format, instead of more typical static image formats.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What features/mechanics common to its genre are missing or might be added?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Some features commonly found in other drawing apps are absent, including a fill bucket tool, as well as tools like a rectangle marquee for selecting regions of the image.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What context, community or niche is it primarily aimed at and what indicates this?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Wigglypaint probably targets an adult, computer software enthusiast audience. Its interface, which resembles the UI of black-and-white Apple Macintosh computers, has a nostalgic appeal.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What did you find annoying and/or boring about interacting with it?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The option to select a different colour palette is not intuitive to find, as it is hidden away in the app's options menu. In addition, creating your own custom palette requires manually inputting a hex code for each colour, as there is no kind of colour selection interface.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What did you find enjoyable about interacting with it?
    </h2>
    <p>
        A big part of Wigglypaint's appeal is that it adds life and personality to anything you draw with it. The limitations put in place by the low resolution and limited colour palette give the app a fun and approachable quality, which further encourages user creativity.
